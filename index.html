[b]BUBBLES[/b][break]Bubbles does exactly what the word bubbles would suggest it does-- it creates a protective bubble of water that can ensnare and cause things within it to float. As witches get stronger, they can increase its defensive capacities. Bubbles aren't the best at holding unwilling targets as they are easily escaped from, but are great for securing objects or vulnerable people. At higher levels, the spell may even secure more hostile targets.[/div][/div]</div></div></div>

[b]WINDBLADE CHRONICLES - CREATION[/b][break]Created by one Jiro Aebersold, an Aer witch obsessed with the idea of a 'perfect blade,' the Windblade chronicles deal with elemental weaponry constructs. 'Creation' allows the witch to create a sword made of air. It's totally invisible and weightless, making it a powerful blade. Beginners, however, will find they cannot contain the wind well enough, and the spell tends to malfunction or 'disperse' at the worst possible moments. It's also not entirely invisible-- it's quite obvious the air around it has shifted, but it may be difficult to detect in the heat of a battle.[/div][/div]</div></div></div>

[b]TEMPERATURE BREAK[/b][break]Pre-req: Modern Mana Sleuth, Vol 6. A basic spell for helping to deal with spells that utilize temperature changes in some manner. While initiates may only be able to break a spell heating spell on a cup of coffee, more experienced witches can break down complicated spells such as a fire tornado or a magical blizzard, or access dangerous, magically created extreme temperature areas. The spell lets the user dissipate the temperature effects of a spell - removing the heat from a fireball (which will still burn flesh and cloth if it has caught), or breaking the frozen part of an icicle to revert it to water (which will still have momentum and could be refrozen or otherwise manipulated).
